    <h1 class="Ass">Assignment 1</h1>
    <h3 class="Ass">In this Assignment, we were given three text files filled with thousands and thousands of numbers, and we were tasked with finding out which text file
    was actually an image for a ball, which was an image for a brick, and which was an image for a cylinder. I was able to write code in javascript and produce the images to an
    html canvas based on the different intensity values of the text files. After loading each image, you should be able to discern which text file was which image.</h3>
